ci process is a developemnt prctice where set of developers  do changes to their scm regulaly and push their changes into a source code repository like git aftere this they is going be an automated process which picks all the changes commited by the developer and it runs this code through some verification  like this 

it compile the code 

it  exicuted test cases against the code 

it also perform static cocde analysisi like using sonarqube by just checking the source code comesout with an reports...

how many blockers

how many errors 
how many worrings 
 then if everything goeswell its going to create soft package which is used for deployment 
if something goes wrong this automated process send a some kind notification back to the evelopers.
